Notes to repro on top of QubesOS debian-12-xfce template based qube

- Clone a debian-12-xfce on top of Q4.2.1 to be specialized
- Deploy QubesOS nix requirements in template: https://dataswamp.org/~solene/2023-05-15-qubes-os-install-nix.html
- Deploy QubesOS requirements for docker: https://gist.github.com/tlaurion/9113983bbdead492735c8438cd14d6cd
- Create a qube based on the cloned template above
- Open qube
- Clone whatever repo is most recent between https://github.com/mmlb/osresearch-heads/tree/wip-nix-for-build or https://github.com/tlaurion/heads/tree/wip-nix-for-build
  - git clone Above_repo
  - cd /home/user/heads           or    cd /home/user/osresearch-heads
  - git checkout wip-nix-for-build
  - git reset --hard



Now, replication traces

#Install nix cleanly:
sudo rm -rf /nix/* || echo "cannot delete /nix" &&  sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install) --no-daemon
#Source nix prior of creating nix cache and jumping in it
. /home/user/.nix-profile/etc/profile.d/nix.sh
#Configure nix for local builds until we have proper docker image instead:
mkdir -p ~/.config/nix
echo 'experimental-features = nix-command flakes' >~/.config/nix/nix.conf
#Build nix developer local env with flakes locks to specified versions and jump into it:
nix --print-build-logs --verbose develop --ignore-environment
#Build a board
make BOARD=nitropad-nv41



In case you need to rebuild from packages+ patches + a clean ./install (where libraries and headers are found):
make real.remove_canary_files-extract_patch_rebuild_what_changed

IF that doesn;t help you, look at the end of the global Helper for more helper. Iterate.



build docker out of nix develop environement and jump into it:
nix build .#dockerImage && docker load < result && docker run --network host --rm -ti -v $(pwd):$(pwd) -w $(pwd) linuxboot/heads:dev-env

From there, rebuild with 
make real.remove_canary_files-extract_patch_rebuild_chat_changed
make BOARD=nitropad-nv41

Make changes until taht part works in both nix layer on top of OS and withing docker image.
......

SUCCESSSSS?!?!?!?! CELEBRATION!
Tell @mmlb and @insurgo on matrix channel!!!!


-------

Some raw and incomplete notes on how to push that docker to dockerhub
docker tag linuxboot/heads:dev-env tlaurion/heads-dev-env:v0.0.3
docker push tlaurion/heads-dev-env:v0.0.3
